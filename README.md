This is a based on the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) framework, as well as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the database.

## Basics

This system will allow a user to register, and then login to search for books to add to their list. Once a book is in the list, it can be selected for reasing. On the reading screen the user can start a timer to track the reading time. When done, clicking the stop button will stop the timer. At this time, the user can log the page in the book they are current at, and the progress information is stored in the database. 

Reports can be generated from this data to show ave pages/min, pages/week, and a weekly reading activity log.
